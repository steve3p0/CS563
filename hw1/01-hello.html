          The Engineering Building is a concrete and glass, five-story building located on SW 4th Avenue just south of the Fourth Avenue Building and City of Portland Development Tower. The basement of the Engineering Building pre-dates its construction and is actually part of the Fourth Avenue Building. Designed by the architectural firm, Zimmer Gunsul Frasca, the Engineering Building was completed in early 2006.
