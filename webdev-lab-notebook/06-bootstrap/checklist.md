## Checklist

Prior to turning in your assignment, complete the following checklist in regards to the code checks. There are several errors in the starter files that you will need to fix.

#### Accessibility Code Check

- [x] Use the Wave AIM browser extension to run an accessibility audit on your completed solutions. 

#### Formatted Code Check

- [x] Use Prettier to properly format your HTML code. (Bootstrap markup can be verbose but should be well-formed.)
- [x] Use Prettier to properly format your CSS code. (The main CSS was the local `styles.css` which was modified to scope a rule.)
- [ ] N/A: Use Prettier to properly format your JavaScript code. (Not applicable for this lab, as the JS for the modal was part of Bootstrap itself.)
