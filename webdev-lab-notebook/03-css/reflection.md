## Reflection Document

### HTML

I learned how class and ID attributes can be used to organize and style content, especially when combined with CSS selectors like attribute selectors or compound class names. Setting up the HTML to support those selectors made me more mindful of naming conventions and hierarchy.

### Accessibility

I had to add main tags to fix a page region error. And the biggest assessibility issue was the low contrast use of colors.
There was 1 alert for not having a first level heading h1 tag.  I added a Selectors h1 tag to rectify this.

### CSS

This week’s CSS exercises helped reinforce key concepts like selector specificity, layout techniques, and responsive design. 

The most helpful parts were the layout and media query exercises. They really forced me to think about how content should reflow on different screen sizes. The specificity exercise also made me more aware of how different types of selectors impact which styles get applied.

It might have helped to also include a couple “spot the bug” examples where I’d have to fix broken CSS layout code—those help reinforce learning.
