## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete the HTML exercises mostly on my own, though I referenced the instructions and screenshots to ensure accuracy. I also reviewed example HTML syntax to double-check best practices, especially for using semantic elements like <figure>, <figcaption>, and proper use of alt attributes.

The exercises were very helpful in reinforcing basic HTML structure and semantic elements. Exercise 02 (Images) stood out because it emphasized accessibility and the proper way to use captions, which was new for me. I also appreciated the emphasis on structured tables in Exercise 03. 

The assignment was unclear with what to anchor the "Cleaning Supplies" item to, so I created a separate list and achored that item to that list.

### Accessibility

Although accessiblity wasn't apart of this assignment, I used the WAVE tool by WebAIM to test all four HTML pages. An alert of "No heading structure" was found for the table HTML exercise.

### CSS

NA.
