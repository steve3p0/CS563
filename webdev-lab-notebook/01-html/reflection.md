## Reflection Document

### HTML

This lab focused on foundational HTML elements and their proper usage to structure web content. I gained hands-on experience with several key HTML elements:

* **Lists:** I implemented both ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists, including nested lists, to organize information hierarchically, such as a grocery list. This reinforced the importance of using appropriate list types for sequential versus non-sequential data. I also used an anchor element (`<a>`) for navigation within the document.
* **Images:** I worked with the `<img>` element to embed images. A significant learning point was the use of `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to provide semantic meaning and captions for images, which is crucial for accessibility and content understanding.
* **Tables:** I created an HTML `<table>` structure, utilizing `<thead>` and `<tbody>` for semantic grouping of table content. The exercises also involved using `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes to merge cells, demonstrating how to create more complex table layouts.
* **Forms:** I built a basic HTML form using various input types, including text for name, email, radio buttons for single selections, and checkboxes for multiple selections. The use of `<label>` associated with inputs, and `<fieldset>` with `<legend>` for grouping related form controls, highlighted best practices for form structure and usability.

Overall, this lab solidified my understanding of fundamental HTML structuring tags and emphasized the importance of choosing the correct tag for the content's semantic meaning.

### Accessibility

While directly running an accessibility audit with Wave AIM was a checklist item, the exercises themselves inherently included elements crucial for accessibility:

* **`alt` attributes for images:** By adding descriptive `alt` text to `<img>` tags, I ensured that screen readers could convey the content of the images to visually impaired users. This is a fundamental aspect of image accessibility.
* **Semantic HTML:** Using elements like `figure`, `figcaption`, `thead`, `tbody`, `fieldset`, and `legend` not only structures the content visually but also provides a more robust and navigable experience for assistive technologies. Properly structured forms with `label` elements linked to their respective inputs are vital for users who rely on keyboards or screen readers.

These practices contribute significantly to making web content understandable and navigable for a broader audience, including those with disabilities.
