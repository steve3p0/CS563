### Accessibility

For the accessibility lab, I focused on fixing issues in a basic form. I used the WAVE accessibility tool to identify problems such as missing labels, improperly grouped form elements, and lack of input associations. I corrected these issues by adding proper label tags, grouping related inputs using fieldset and legend, and ensuring all inputs had accessible names.

The exercise was helpful in understanding how even a simple form can present significant accessibility barriers. I especially appreciated how WAVE highlighted contrast and label problems, making it easier to fix them one by one.

I did get one alert that stating that I had no page regions, so I wrapped everything in the body in a main tag.
